    "\n",

    "\n",
    "From our understanding of the two methods, the mean would be more sensitive to outliers in the playlist and result in songs that were less similar to most of the songs in the playlist, whereas the median would be find songs that were more homogenous with the rest of the playlist."

    "1) Use statistical tests to determine if the numeric features of the recommendations were \"different\" from our input playlist\n",
    "2) Use the T-SNE dimension reduction to cluster songs together and see if our recommendations were close to the playlist songs\n",
    "3) Use our group members' own playlists and ask them for their opinion."
